**Info 201 AG project.**  
Our project is US Hate-Crime Reportings.We will work on the data about hate crime happened in U.S. This is the link to our project proposal: https://github.com/HanzhangHu/operation_awareness-/wiki<br/>
Hate crimes are an ongoing concern in the United States, as thousands are being targeted and attacked based on their race, gender, sexuality or religion. Individuals who are directly impacted by this fall under minority groups such as people of color, LGBTQ+, etc. <br/>
With our project, we hope to use our data visualizations and statistics we collected to highlight the disparities in underreported hate crime to reported hate crime in major cities.
