**Info 201 AG project.**  
Our project is on Hate-Crime Reportings in the United States and Seattle. Hate crimes are an ongoing concern in the United States, as significant number of people are targeted based on their race, gender, sexuality or religion. Individuals who are directly impacted by this fall under minority groups such as people of color, LGBTQ+, etc. With our project, we hope to use our data visualizations and statistics to highlight possible correlation between average hate crime rate and Trump voters and median income in different states. We also pinpointed which month had what categories of crimes in Seattle greater area. <br/>
