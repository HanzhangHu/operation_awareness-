**Info 201 AG project.**  
Our project is on Hate-Crime Reportings in the United States and Seattle. Hate crimes are an ongoing concern in the United States, as significant number of people are targeted based on their race, gender, sexuality or religion. Individuals who are directly impacted by this fall under minority groups such as people of color, LGBTQ+, etc. With our project, we hope to use our data visualizations and statistics to highlight the disparities in hate crime reporting in different areas of the US and Seattle. <br/>
